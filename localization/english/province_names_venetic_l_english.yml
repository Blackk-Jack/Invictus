PROV3584_venetic:0 "Verona" 
PROV3589_venetic:0 "Hostillia" 
PROV3593_venetic:0 "Atria"   #Early city name, it is unknown what the Veneti called it
PROV3594_venetic:0 "Patavnos" #attested https://www.academia.edu/74888843/A_Venetic_Sound_Change
PROV3595_venetic:0 "Ateste"    
PROV3596_venetic:0 "Veiketinos" #alegedly attested (italian wikipedia) and https://www.jstor.org/stable/41746973?seq=13 (I also switched the c to a k, since the Venetic alphabet used a kappa)
PROV3597_venetic:0 "Anneianom" #my guess 
PROV3598_venetic:0 "Altinom"   #somewhat attested, city named after the venetic god Altino #2022 source: https://www.torrossa.com/en/resources/an/5310859
PROV3599_venetic:0 "Tarvosios" #Tarvisium in latin alegedly stems from a Venetic Theonym including the Celtic god Tarvos. So I have made it a derivative
PROV3600_venetic:0 "Akelon"   #my guess, Acelum in latin / also attested in an inscription near Asolo (suggested as a Toponym for Asolo, in which case my guess was very lucky): https://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/aristonothos/article/view/13730/12926
PROV3601_venetic:0 "Portos Likventia"   #my guess - qu -> kv, latin 'equus' -> venetic 'ekvos', and based on the Proto-Italic word for Liquidae in latin
PROV3603_venetic:0 "Opitergios"   #my guess, terg (venetic root for market) ios (of/from) Opi (in the latin name of Opitergium, probably comes from the original name).
PROV3604_venetic:0 "Belodunom"   #my guess, venetic version of Belo-dunun
PROV3605_venetic:0 "Foron Rakos" #Foron, my guess for the Venetic of Forum, based on both the Proto-Italic Pworom, with Rakos, wich is likely the Venetic equivalent to Rex
PROV3606_venetic:0 "Akileia"   #Akileja - Carnian name before the Roman arrival
PROV3590_venetic:0 "Monteboulenos" #Montebellum, this gramatical case for 'mountain' in Venetic was probably very similar to latin, and Bellum aparrently comes from the celtic god Bellenos (or Boulenos in Venetic). - found no reliable source, will disable untill frurther notice
PROV4018_venetic:0 "Tergeste" 
PROV3602_venetic:0 "Konkordia" #The latin name of the city has the same roots as in Venetic, so I just changed the Cs to Ks, as the Veneti used the letter K for the K sound.
PROV4026_venetic:0 "Longatikon"
PROV4025_venetic:0 "Karnion"
PROV1887_venetic:0 "Pompeopedos" #my guess - opedos/opedon -> town (cognate with oppidum), "Town of Pompy" ///PLAUSIBLE BUT UNECESSARY, NOT A VENETIC HELD TERRITORY
PROV3571_venetic:0 "Mediolanos" #my guess - Mediios -> Medio  ///PLAUSIBLE BUT UNECESSARY, NOT A VENETIC HELD TERRITORY 
PROV3581_venetic:0 "Briksia" #my guess, replaces 'x' with ks, as the veneti didn't have a letter x ///PLAUSIBLE BUT UNECESSARY, NOT A VENETIC HELD TERRITORY
