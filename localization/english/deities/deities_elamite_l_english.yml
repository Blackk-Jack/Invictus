 omen_inshushinak:0 "Inshushinak"
 omen_inshushinak_desc:0 "Inshushinak is the god of the Elamite city of Susa. He is sometimes called the greatest of all gods in Elamite mythology. He is seen as a powerful god of the underworld, and sometimes within the entourage of the powerful Mesopotamian goddess, Ereshkigal.\n\nIn Achaemenid Persia, Inshushinak lost much of his prominence outside of Susa itself. While he was once the greatest of the gods, other gods like Humban gained more importance in the post Neo-Elamite period. This stated, there are disagreements on if he was any less important to the Elamites themselves, or if the Indo-Iranian people simply neglected and disaproved of his veneration."

 omen_napirisha:0 "Napirisha"
 omen_napirisha_desc:0 "Napirisha is the great god of the Kingdom of Anshan from the ancient times of the 3rd millenium BCE. Napirisha often takes the form of a primordial snake that represents the original waters of the world. For this reason, the Mesopotamians often compared him to their god, Enki, of the freshwaters. Napirisha and his consort, Kiririsha, were venerated in Susa with their titular god of Inshushinak."

 deity_ishnikarab:0 "$omen_ishnikarab$"
 omen_ishnikarab:0 "Ishmekaraba"
 omen_ishnikarab_desc:0 "Ishmekaraba started as an Akkadian deity known as Ishnikarab, however they were also of great importance to the Elamites. Ishmekaraba was a deity of justice and oaths. In Elamite mythology, although it is debated, many believe that Ishmekaraba was the spouse to the god of Susa, Ishushinak. She would later remain relevant and possibly contribute, along with her husband and a god named Lagamal, to the Zoroastrian belief of a triad of deities who pass judgment on souls."

 deity_lagamal:0 "$omen_lagamal$"
 omen_lagamal:0 "Lagamal"
 omen_lagamal_desc:0 "Lagamal started as an Akkadian deity, however they became an integral part to the Elamite pantheon after being introduced in Susa. Lagamal was a god of the underworld who judged the souls of the dead. He would be included amongst a group of three gods; himself, Inshushinak, and Ishnikarab; who possibly influenced the Zoroastrian belief of a triad of deities who pass judgement upon souls."

 deity_manzat:0 "$omen_manzat$"
 omen_manzat:0 "Manzat"
 omen_ashshur_desc:0 "The goddess of the rainbow, Manzat, was primarily worshipped in the Elamite lowlands, as well as in both Sumeria and Akkad, though it is not known if she originates from Mesopotamia or Elam. Manzat was especially venerated in an area near Susa known as Hubshen. The goddess was associated with prosperity, especially of cities. She is sometimes called 'Great Lady' in the Elamite language. She became incredibly rare in attestations after the first millenium BCE, showing she was likely less important after that era."

 deity_tepti:0 "$omen_tepti$"
 omen_tepti:0 "Tepti"
 omen_tepti_desc:0 "Little is known about the mysterious deity referred to as Tepti. They appear in texts from the Neo-Elamite period, as well as in the names of some Elamite kings. In an inscription, it describes Tepti, Napirisha, and Kiririsha as deities who have always protected the waters and the earth. While Kiririsha is commonly attributed to protecting the earth, and Napirisha is well attested to be a god of water, Tepti's role in the triad is not known.."

 deity_tirutur:0 "$omen_tirutur$"
 omen_tirutur:0 "Tirutur"
 omen_tirutur_desc:0 "Tirutur is a mysterious god of which not much is written. He is mentioned in Neo-Elamite sources. Tirutur, along with Inshushinak, Tepti, and Humban, were associated with great divine and kingly powers, as well as a concept called 'Ktin,' which is best described as a divine protection for the people or kings of a land. During Achaemenid rule, Tirutur was conflated with Humban by the Persians."

 deity_shihhash:0 "$omen_shihhash$"
 omen_shihhash:0 "Shihhash"
 omen_shihhash_desc:0 "Shihhash is the Elamite version of the Canaanite god Adad. While it is not known if these are three seperate gods, or all the same god, the Elamites had three epithets for Shihhash which are Shihhash, Shennukushu, and Kunzibami. As a version of Adad, Shihhash in Elamite religion is likely much more similar to the Mesopotamian versions, as even the name is likely from Mesopotamian origin."

 deity_simut:0 "$omen_simut$"
 omen_simut:0 "Simut"
 omen_simut_desc:0 "Simut, also called Shimut, is known as the 'Herald of the Gods' in Elamite mythology. Shimut was associated with the concept of 'Ktin,' similar to many prominent gods in Elamite religion. Simut would find himself often compared or syncrotized with the Mesopotamian god Nergal, however recent research disputes the idea of Simut being an underworld god to the Elamites. It's possible he played some other role that was identified with Nergal."

 deity_pinikir:0 "$omen_pinikir$"
 omen_pinikir:0 "Pinigir"
 omen_pinikir_desc:0 "Also called Pinikir, Pinigir is a powerful goddess of Elamite origin, who was also widespread in Hurrian religion. She was associated with themes similar to that of Ishtar. She was a goddess of love and sex, but like Ishtar, she was also associated with war and stars, especially in her Hurrian version. Pinigir was worshipped in Elam until at least 500 BCE when the Neo-Assyrians burned her temple in Susa to the ground. It is more than likely she remained a relevant deity afterwards considering her prominence across Middle-Eastern pantheons."

 deity_hutran:0 "$omen_ashshur$"
 omen_hutran:0 "Hutran"
 omen_hutran_desc:0 "Hutran is a god of divinity and kingship, much like Humban and Inshushinak. In fact, Hutran formed a godly triad within Elamite mythos. This triad often compared to the godly triad Hormazd-Mithra-Anahita in Indo-Iranic pantheons."
