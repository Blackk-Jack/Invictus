#Missions

01_caledonian_missions_task_1: "We Are In Agreement"
01_caledonian_missions_task_1_DESC: "Although it is an onerous task to get our Tribal Chieftains to agree on anything, if we are able to establish a stable peace at home, then we shall be able to convince our warriors of the benefits to waging war abroad. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_2: "Then It Must Be War"
01_caledonian_missions_task_2_DESC: "For far too long, we have suffered immeasurable damage from the internecine warfare waged by our kinsmen; we must put an end to this. The only way to secure a lasting peace in #E Caledonia#! is to prepare for war. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil15!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_3: "Pictish Mines"
01_caledonian_missions_task_3_DESC: "The lands we inhabit are a source of valuable mineral wealth, and there are plenty of people who will pay a premium for our metals - let us be sure to sell it to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_4: "Taking #E Taexalia#!"
01_caledonian_missions_task_4_DESC: "The Taexalian and Damnonian tribes to our south are weak, sniveling worms who cannot hope to stand against [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] levies in the field! Let us drive our enemies out of their lands and into the sea! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil5!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_5: "Crossing The Mare Hibernicum "
01_caledonian_missions_task_5_DESC: "Wood is scarce where we come from, but this unfortunate fact of nature does not mean that we do not require lumber. There are many benefits to stockpiling wood; not only can we build ships, but we can then send our navy to distant shores if need be...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil6!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_6: "Pictish Raiders"
01_caledonian_missions_task_6_DESC: "Our warriors clamor for battle, lusting to be unleashed upon the lands of our enemies to the south and the west - all [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has to do is say the word and our raiders will leave immediately. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil7!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_7: "The Chambered Cairns Of #E Orcades#!"
01_caledonian_missions_task_7_DESC: "It is believed that there are some ancient gravesites in [GetProvince('(int32)2132').GetName] that are worth investigating, if we have the money to send an expedition.\n\nThis will start an #Y Event Chain#!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil16!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_8: "Tribal Settlers"
01_caledonian_missions_task_8_DESC: "Peace has finally been achieved, but we must not rest on our laurels - quite the contrary. If we want to establish our hold over the lands that we have fought so bitterly for, then we must move our tribesmen to the uninhabited places that surround us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil2!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_9: "Caledonian Stoneworks"
01_caledonian_missions_task_9_DESC: "One of the many gifts that [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_forge_god')] has bestowed upon our people is easy access to mineral wealth, whether it be stone, precious metals like gold and silver, or base metals that our blacksmiths so desperately crave. Let us not shirk in our duties, but let us build mines so that we can obtain the building materials that our people desire. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_10: "Highland Hunting"
01_caledonian_missions_task_10_DESC: "Some friends of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] have been talking about going out into the wilderness for a hunt, an activity that is much beloved by the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people.\n\n#Y This will start an event chain#!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil13!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_11: "Salt Farms Of #E Novantae#!"
01_caledonian_missions_task_11_DESC: "Salt is one of the most precious commodities available, required for many aspects of day to day life, and we should make sure that we utilize the natural resources of [GetProvince('(int32)2109').GetName] as soon as we can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil2!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_12: "Trading This For That"
01_caledonian_missions_task_12_DESC: "Bartering has long played an important role in the economic life of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], but now [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided to throw the full weight of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] state behind these initiatives. We must build a special market in our capital that will allow our people to meet and trade freely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic13!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_13: "A Caledonian Capital"
01_caledonian_missions_task_13_DESC: "The authority of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has become undeniable over the last few years, with out Tribal Elders being more and more willing to defer to the orders coming out of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. One way that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has cemented [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] legacy in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is by commanding that a true city be built.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil8!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_14: "A Question Of Honor"
01_caledonian_missions_task_14_DESC: "As our standing improves at home, there are voices who claim that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is not fit to lead the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people. Let us silence these wagging tongues once and for all with a display of martial skill. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil1!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_15: "The World Will Burn!"
01_caledonian_missions_task_15_DESC: "The hour of our supreme dominance is at hand! No one can stand before us; our levies are prepared to set the world afire!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil4!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_16: "Bartering With The Mainland"
01_caledonian_missions_task_16_DESC: "While most of what our people desire can be found within our own borders, there are some goods that can only be found abroad. Let us see what we can do to to boost our trade connections with the mainland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_17: "Renowned Fish Exporters"
01_caledonian_missions_task_17_DESC: "One would assume that our proximity to the sea ensures that fish is a main staple of our diet, but this is untrue - we prefer barley and meat, but our aversion to eating the local catch does not mean that we shouldn't export the foodstuffs to our neighbors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"


01_caledonian_missions_task_18: "The Caledonian Confederacy"
01_caledonian_missions_task_18_DESC: "Let the entire world look upon the mighty deeds that we have accomplished by force of arms - may our enemies tremble at the announcement of our Confederacy! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_19: "Painted Warriors"
01_caledonian_missions_task_19_DESC: "Our levies like to cover their bodies with woad @woad!, striking terror into the hearts of those that foolishly stand against our painted warriors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil11!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_20: "Sacking The Sacred Spaces"
01_caledonian_missions_task_20_DESC: "We will not stop our raiders from sacking whatever they will; whether it be a city, a settlement, a grave or a temple, all is fair game for our warriors! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_21: "The Painted City"
01_caledonian_missions_task_21_DESC: "As our power and authority grows, we find cities naturally growing within our lands - the homes of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people can no longer be limited to humble villages any longer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic11!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_22: "The Conquest of Hibernia"
01_caledonian_missions_task_22_DESC: "Now that we have the province of #E Hibernia Septentrionalis#! in our possession, we shall quickly take the rest of the island for ourselves. We hope that there is room in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] for all of the slaves that we anticipate capturing...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil9!"

01_caledonian_missions_task_23: "Pictish Slave Ships"
01_caledonian_missions_task_23_DESC: "We must empower our navies with the ability to raid and plunder, just like our levies do on the dry land. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"
