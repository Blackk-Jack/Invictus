 getae_mission_01_inv_DESCRIPTION: "Our people, the settled tribes of the #E Getae#!, inhabit the wooded hills that sweep south of the #E Carpathian Mountains#! to our north, and our dominion ends where the mighty waters of the #E River Ister#! separate us from the #E Thracians#! that live on its southern shores.\n\nAlthough we are far removed from the conflicts we have heard of in Asia, times are changing for us, as well; the eastern coastal cities are swelling with #E Greek#! colonists that are casting a hungry eye on our territories, and there are fierce barbarians around us that would not hesitate to seize our homes if our guard should fall.\n\nThere are many impediments in our way, and yet our destiny calls us - we must rise above it all and unite the #E Dacians#! under one sword, becoming a shield against any that would stand against us."
 getae_mission_01_inv_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be considered complete when we have formed the nation of #E Dacia#! and have built a capital city worthy of the name."

 getae_mission_01_inv_14_task_DESC: "There are many reasons that we should build up the territory of [GetProvince('(int32)4282').GetName]; its commanding position allows it to control access in and out of the western mountains, and would be a magnificent location for a fortified city. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil23!"

 me_getae_1_desc: "The War Council held at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] has drawn to a close, although [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is still at a loss for what should be done about the Greek settlements on the coasts.\n\n[SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude').GetName], the firebrand from the [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude').GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] Clan, has argued that we should conquer the Greek cities outright, enumerating the very good reasons for this course of action in detail. Claiming that these fortified trading cities represents an existential threat to the future of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude').GetFirstName] has been pressing for a military campaign that will stamp out this danger once and for all.\n\nOf course, there is no universal consensus. [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetName] believes that a policy of coexistence is the wisest course of action, asking if we can afford to anger the #E Thracians#!, who could easily smash our forces if they had the political will to do so. Instead of gathering our levies, [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetFirstName] is asking [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] to prepare a grand diplomatic gesture, one that will captivate the hearts of the Greeks and show them that we are reliable partners in this region.\n\nThe arguments between the Chieftains remained cordial, but the underlying tension between the two shows how contentious this issue is. Unfortunately for our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], there are no easy answers."

The only 'complication', as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] described it, was that this course of action will bring us into conflict with the #E Carpians#!, who have constructed impressive fortifications on our border.\n\nArguing that the fortress of [GetProvince('(int32)4800').GetName] will be painful for our men to take, [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude').GetName] has suggested that we simultaneously prepare claims to the south - there is a natural river crossing near [GetProvince('(int32)4809').GetName] that could take our forces into the province of #E Crobyzoia#!.\n\nThis 'southern strategy' has its detractors, however; [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetName] argues that this is a frivolous expense that stretches our resources when we need them the most."
