 getae_mission_01_inv: "Sword and Shield of The Dacians"
 getae_mission_01_inv_DESCRIPTION: "Our people, the settled tribes of the #E Getae#!, inhabit the wooded hills that sweep south of the #E Carpathian Mountains#! to our north, and our dominion ends where the mighty waters of the #E River Ister#! separate us from the #E Thracians#! that live on its southern shores.\n\nAlthough we are far removed from the conflicts we have heard of in Asia, times are changing for us, as well; the eastern coastal cities are swelling with #E Greek#! colonists that are casting a hungry eye on our territories, and there are fierce barbarians around us that would not hesitate to seize our homes if our guard should fall.\n\nThere are many impediments in our way, and yet our destiny calls us - we must rise above it all and unite the #E Dacians#! under one sword, becoming a shield against any that would stand against us."
 getae_mission_01_inv_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be considered complete when we have formed the nation of #E Dacia#! and have built a capital city worthy of the name."
 getae_mission_01_inv_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "No one shall stand in the way of our dream - the formation of mighty #E Dacia#!..."
