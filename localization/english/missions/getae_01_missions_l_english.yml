 getae_mission_01_inv: "Sword and Shield of The Dacians"
 getae_mission_01_inv_DESCRIPTION: "Our people, the settled tribes of the #E Getae#!, inhabit the wooded hills that sweep south of the #E Carpathian Mountains#! to our north, and our dominion ends where the mighty waters of the #E River Ister#! separate us from the #E Thracians#! that live on its southern shores.\n\nAlthough we are far removed from the conflicts we have heard of in Asia, times are changing for us, as well; the eastern coastal cities are swelling with #E Greek#! colonists that are casting a hungry eye on our territories, and there are fierce barbarians around us that would not hesitate to seize our homes if our guard should fall.\n\nThere are many impediments in our way, and yet our destiny calls us - we must rise above it all and unite the #E Dacians#! under one sword, becoming a shield against any that would stand against us."
 getae_mission_01_inv_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be considered complete when we have formed the nation of #E Dacia#! and have built a capital city worthy of the name."
 getae_mission_01_inv_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "No one shall stand in the way of our dream - the formation of mighty #E Dacia#!..."

 ####################


 getae_mission_01_inv_1_task: "Friends Or Foes?"
 getae_mission_01_inv_1_task_DESC: "We cannot afford to ignore the presence of the #Y Greeks#! on the eastern coasts - these Thracian lapdogs might nip at our ankles when we least expect it.\n\nLet us convene a tribal council in order to decide our approach to these foreigners while we prepare our claims, just in case...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"

 getae_mission_01_inv_2_task_DESC: "The quickest way to the coast lies through the lands inhabited by #E Carpia#!, but this is a temporary distraction that we aim to rectify. If we move quickly enough, we can take this vital overland route for ourselves, but we must make sure that we are ready for the conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"

 getae_mission_01_inv_4_task_DESC: "Our growing nation is hungry for the raw material goods needed to build an empire; we have just as much need for wood and stone as we do wine and bread.

 getae_mission_01_inv_6_task: "Getian Galleys"
 getae_mission_01_inv_6_task_DESC: "Now that we have established a trading hub in [GetProvince('(int32)4519').GetName], we need a proper fleet that can run goods to and from the coasts.

 getae_mission_01_inv_7_task: "Conqueror Of The Coasts"
 getae_mission_01_inv_7_task_DESC: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has led our forces to their greatest victories yet, conquering cities that have prepared for our advance and yet still were found wanting.\n\nThe greatest prize of all glimmers, just barely out of reach; the capital city of #E Lysimachus#! and control of the #E Bosporus#! region itself.

 getae_mission_01_inv_8_task: "Claiming The Cities"
 getae_mission_01_inv_8_task_DESC: "At long last, we have managed to destroy the defenses of the coastal Greeks, taking their many rich cities for ourselves.

 getae_mission_01_inv_9_task_DESC: "Some have questioned if [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has the martial skill to lead [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to glory.

 getae_mission_01_inv_10_task: "Clear Out The Bandit Camps"
 getae_mission_01_inv_10_task_DESC: "We have received word that a group of escaped slaves have made a bandit camp somewhere in the mountains, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] wants to see them destroyed.\n\n#Y This will start an event chain#!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil12!"

 getae_mission_01_inv_12_task: "The Rise Of #E Dacia#!"
 getae_mission_01_inv_12_task_DESC: "Let our enemies tremble at what we have achieved today - the acceptance of our birthright, the formation of #E Dacia#!. No longer shall we have reason to fear those around us, for our power is unquestioned and our authority radiates from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName].

 getae_mission_01_inv_14_task: "Strengthening [GetProvince('(int32)4282').GetName]"
 getae_mission_01_inv_14_task_DESC: "There are many reasons that we should build up the territory of [GetProvince('(int32)4282').GetName]; its commanding position allows it to control access in and out of the western mountains, and would be a magnificent location for a fortified city. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil23!"

 getae_mission_01_inv_16_task: "Master Of The Foothills"
 getae_mission_01_inv_16_task_DESC: "Now that we have conquered the rough foothills that surround the mountain ranges that we have claimed, there are no physical barriers to our troops pouring north - we are the masters of these badlands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil2!"

 getae_mission_01_inv_18_task_DESC: "In our quest to form #E Dacia#!, we have had to fight against the #E Gallic#! tribes in the hinterlands to our west - an undesirable situation that we find ourselves in once more.
