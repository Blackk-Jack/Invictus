nabhapakti_missions_task_1:0 "Made of Hundreds of Flowers"
nabhapakti_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "Nabhapakti sits between the mountains of the Himilayas and the mountain of an empire in the Mauryans. It will take resources and unity from the people in order to succeed."

nabhapakti_missions_task_2:0 "Into the Dragon's Mouth"
nabhapakti_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "In order to succeed in the longrun, it is necessary to safeguard our nation by becoming a vassal to the powerful Mauryan Empire."

nabhapakti_missions_task_3:0 "Legacy of the Shakya"
nabhapakti_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "Long gone are the Republics of the Koliyas, Moriyas, Mallakas, and the Shakyas, however, we can reinstate ourselves and honor the legacy of the Shakya Republic."

nabhapakti_missions_task_4:0 "King of the Nepali"
nabhapakti_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "The Nepali people have been displaced into the mountains, and we remain the last tribe of the Nepali. In order to face the stronger powers within the region, we should centralize into a Kingdom, and establish a Kingdom for the Nepali."

nabhapakti_missions_task_5:0 "Question of Capital"
nabhapakti_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "The city of Selanpura is a fine capital, however, it may make sense to establish new capital in Malla, which holds the legacy and prestige of the Shakya."
