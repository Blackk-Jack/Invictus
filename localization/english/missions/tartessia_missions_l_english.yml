 tartessia_mission_inv_1_task_DESC: "In a few months, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] shall soon make a bold proclamation - the tribes of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] hereby acknowledge our intention to reforge the broken pieces of the #T Tartessian Monarchy#! back together again, with its crown and sundered authority claimed by the House of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayName]! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"

 tartessia_mission_inv_2_task: "Carthaginian Contacts"
 tartessia_mission_inv_2_task_DESC: "The might of #E Carthage#! is too powerful to ignore, and although we might find ourselves facing her armies one day in the future, for now, it makes sense for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to maintain the good connections that we currently enjoy.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has sent an embassy to the city of [GetProvince('(int32)3061').GetName] in hopes of securing our friendship - let us see how our overtures are received.\n\n#Y This will start an event chain.#!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"

 tartessia_mission_inv_3_task: "Restore The Ancient Mines"
 tartessia_mission_inv_3_task_DESC: "In days of old, the material strength of the #E Tartessians#! was secured by the mineral wealth taken from the nearby mountains, and although the Earth has already given our ancestors much of her treasures, there yet remains ore to be found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"
 have_mine_tartessia_tt: "We need to own #Y 1 Mine#! within our nation."

 tartessia_mission_inv_4_task: ""
 tartessia_mission_inv_4_task_DESC: "The chaotic political state of our island, with no clear hegemon exerting their authority over the numerous city-states, has resulted in a situation where nearly every province is fortified. Our soldiers, especially those operating our siege engines, have their work cut out for them.\n\nIt goes without saying that maintaining such an elite military unit has its associated costs...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"

 tartessia_mission_inv_5_task: ""
 tartessia_mission_inv_5_task_DESC: "For every new city that we take, we have made it known that the first soldier to scale over the walls of an enemy city will receive a gold coin, paid from the state treasury. Now, all are clamoring for this honor, fighting like they are possessed by infernal spirits! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"

 tartessia_mission_inv_6_task: ""
 tartessia_mission_inv_6_task_DESC: "Our wars of conquest have been devastating on our communities, this is known, but our present circumstances have forced us to draw even deeper from this well, squeezing every available drop of manpower from our villages and cities. We shall never forget this priceless gift given to us by our mothers and sisters, and promise to fight for the dream of Crete! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil9!"
 
 tartessia_mission_inv_7_task: "Greek Trading Connections"
 tartessia_mission_inv_7_task_DESC: "Greek merchants from as far away as [GetProvince('(int32)84').GetName] and even [GetProvince('(int32)516').GetName] sometimes visit our markets at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], prompting [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to propose that these trading connections be made into something permanent. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil11!"

 tartessia_mission_inv_8_task: "Tartessian Coinage"
 tartessia_mission_inv_8_task_DESC: "Some have claimed that Crete was a land filled with impregnable cities, all populated by thieves, liars and pirates. As our recent successes have demonstrated, the first portion of this adage is clearly untrue. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil15!"

 thicc_tartessia_tt:0 "You must directly own at least eight provinces on the island of Crete."

 tartessia_mission_inv_9_task: ""
 tartessia_mission_inv_9_task_DESC: "Our scouts have finished exploring the province of [GetProvince('(int32)358').GetName] and claim that we must pay a visit to the ancient ruins ourselves. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"

 tartessia_mission_inv_10_task: "Rebirth Of Tartessia"
 tartessia_mission_inv_10_task_DESC: "In times of old, Crete was under the dominion of one power, and we are ready to announce to the world that these days have returned. The disorderly period that gave rise to our ascendance, one frought with danger and misery for the people of our island, has finally come to an end.\n\nAs our predecessors in glory, the Minoans, once ruled Crete from [GetProvince('(int32)358').GetName], it is only fitting that we do so ourselves. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"

 me_tartessia_1_title: "Heirs Of Tartessia"
 me_tartessia_1_desc: "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] might be the most unpopular man in the army camps right now, a distinction that the fiery leader bears with stoic indifference. The reason that [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is causing so much complaining is simple; our soldiers are drilling three, four times as harder as they were before, and although rations have been slightly increased to make up for the grueling pace, there are plenty of enlisted who are unhappy.\n\nWhen approached by some of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] closest military advisors, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] rebuffed any attempts to slacken the workload, the same refrain on [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] lips."
 me_tartessia_1.a: "We need to fight as one if we have any hopes of surviving, let alone winning!"
 me_tartessia_1_tooltip: "The mission task '#Y Heirs Of Tartessia#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_tartessia_2_title: "Carthaginian Contacts"
 me_tartessia_2_desc:0 "Although we were practically bankrupted by the decision, in the end, we decided to listen to the admonishments of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who had strongly advised against sending our men into the field unless they had the best equipment available on the market. Although all can agree that our warriors look splendid, some of our leading citizens have complained about the exorbitant expense.\n\n'How can we hope to stand against anyone if we rely on our men to bring their own weapons?' [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] had persuasively argued. 'Your grandfather's sling won't be of any use if our enemies have iron swords. If we want to succeed in our dream of uniting Crete, we must do what no one before us has ever done, the costs be damned!'"
 me_tartessia_2.a:0 "There is merit in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s words..."
 me_tartessia_2_tooltip: "The mission task '#Y Carthaginian Contacts#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_tartessia_3_title: "Restore The Ancient Mines"
 me_tartessia_3_desc:0 "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has called together the leading families from our city, tapping deep into [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] client network to ensure that a receptive audience is present for [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] speech - every favor and debt that [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is owed has been remembered.\n\nWhen the appointed hour has arrived, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] raises [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] hand, calling for silence as [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] launches into an oration, giving a magnificent speech entitled 'An Unruly State of Affairs'. Arguing that the fractured Cretan polity is bound for destruction unless we gather ourselves together as one, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] eloquently paints a picture of impending doom. Promising that [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has a vision to avert this calamitous future, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] warns us that dark times await us, and yet the sun shall one day rise - but this will require the trust and support of our people in the dark days ahead.\n\nHours later, as the crowd disperses from the assembly, the mood was grim. Not everyone was persuaded by [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s words, but there is unanimous belief that war will soon engulf our region."
 me_tartessia_3.a:0 "Nevertheless, I shall bring peace to this unordered realm"
 me_tartessia_3_tooltip: "The mission task '#Y Restore The Ancient Mines#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_tartessia_4_title:0 "Siegeworks and Sappers"
 me_tartessia_4_desc:0 "There have been official complaints lodged by our accountants now that the costs associated with the training and equipping of our sapper units has been realized. Despite being warned that our funds are being stretched dangerously thin, our engineers are now beginning to craft siegeworks, an additional expense which has raised eyebrows throughout our city. [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] listened to the grievances without saying anything at first, but quickly ended any further arguments with a dry comment before turning back to watch the construction.\n\n'Tell me how much it would cost to have our army sitting outside of a city's walls for two years, and you will find that I have saved us a fortune.'"
 me_tartessia_4.a:0 "I assure you, these highly-trained troops will win the day for us!"
 me_tartessia_4_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y Siegeworks and Sappers#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_tartessia_5_title:0 "A Gold Coin to the First Man"
 me_tartessia_5_desc:0 "What a change in affairs! Truly man is a capricious creature. Not only a few months ago, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] was regularly cursed by the same soldier that sings [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] praises now. Why the sudden change in tune, one might ask? Last week, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] addressed the troops in camp, promising to personally give a golden coin to the first man to scale the walls of an enemy city.\n\nOur soldiers are clamoring for the opportunity to achieve this honor, with many dreaming of securing this windfall for themselves. What a brilliant strategy [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has put into place!"
 me_tartessia_5.a:0 "There's nothing wrong with...encouraging...the men to do their duty"
 me_tartessia_5_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y A Gold Coin to the First Man#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_tartessia_6_title:0 "Squeezing Every Last Drop"
 me_tartessia_6_desc:0 "Our recent gains in the field have been staggering, but have come at a deadly cost to our men. It is acknowledged that we are running low on manpower, and without more bodies to fill in the gaps in our lines, we stand to lose everything we have gained thus far.\n\nRealizing the gravity of the situation, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] made the unpopular decision to send soldiers to the marketplaces, gathering anyone who looked capable of holding a spear, and impressing them into military service.\n\nAn unprecedented action, but these are the times that we live in, unfortunately. "
 me_tartessia_6.a:0 "Seize any able-bodied man and send them to the training camps at once"
 me_tartessia_6_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y Squeezing Every Last Drop#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_tartessia_7_title: "Greek Trading Connections"
 me_tartessia_7_desc:0 "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is acquiring a reputation for making difficult decisions, even at the expense of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] popularity. Claiming that it is nigh impossible to feed both our armies and our citizens, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has ordered that bread be rationed in the cities. While many still put their faith into [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], there are some who whisper that [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] is nothing more than a tyrant, looking for the first opportunity to seize power from a starving populace.\n\nOne will have to strain their ears to hear these treasonous murmurings, however, especially over the grumbling of empty stomachs."
 me_tartessia_7.a:0 "One day, there will be free bread for all, but for now, we must sacrifice"
 me_tartessia_7_tooltip: "The mission task '#Y Greek Trading Connections#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_tartessia_8_title: "Tartessian Coinage"
 me_tartessia_8_desc:0 "Although many of the policies enacted by [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] have had their fair share of detractors, no one can claim that [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has not delivered what was promised. For the first time in years, there is an ascendant power on Crete; our incomes, territories and influence grow, while our achievements are acknowledged throughout the wider world.\n\n[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] leads us towards victory; we put our entire faith into [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim]!"
 me_tartessia_8.a:0 "There is still so much more to be done"
 me_tartessia_8_tooltip: "The mission task '#Y Tartessian Coinage#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_tartessia_9_title:0 "The Bull-Leapers"
 me_tartessia_9_desc:0 "The Palace at [GetProvince('(int32)358').GetName], once home to legendary kings, still exists in a semi-ruined state, and although there are countless duties that require every bit of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s free time, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has decided to pay a personal visit to the area, believing that some old-fashioned sightseeing might do wonders for [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] stress levels.\n\nIt was mid-morning when [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], having breakfasted on the hilly terrain overlooking the grounds, decided to venture inside the palace itself. There, in the gloom and silence, a fresco on one of the eastern walls took [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] breath away. Painted onto stucco paneling was a scene that showed a charging bull, magnificent and terrible, threatening to destroy all that stood before its rampaging hooves, and yet there were acrobats, laughing and unafraid, nimbly leaping over the beast.\n\nIn a voice choked with emotion, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] says 'I see myself and our struggle in these paintings...never ones to shirk from danger, but bravely facing foward, grabbing the bull by the horns and floating above the chaos with elegance and grace. Let us leave this place, but take this lesson with us.'"

For years, our leader had to deal with the vicious strategies of enemy generals, all while navigating the fraught political climate and tight pursestrings on the home front - a feat that seemed impossible before [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] proved that it could be done. The streets are filled with raucous celebration, with voices that once accused [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] of being a despot now singing [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] eternal praise.\n\nEven now, as nearly universal acclaim is showered upon [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] remains unusually taciturn...in the hour of triumph, it appears that there still remains something on [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] mind?"
