# Tylos mission tree
tylos_missions: "Revival of Babylon"
tylos_missions_DESCRIPTION: "On our island of #E Tylos#!, we currently walk along the razor's edge; 'protected' by the #E Seleukid Empire#!, who casts a hungry eye on our wealthy ports and gemstones, we are surrounded by aggressive Republics that would love to annex our borders. Needless to say, both friend and foe have set themselves up against us, and only time will tell if we are able to achieve a long-forgotten dream - the #E Revival of Babylon.#!"

tylos_missions_task_9: "A Rich Memory"
tylos_missions_task_9_DESC: "In days of old, it is said that the Babylonians administered their lands using a specialized type of bureaucracy, and while this was very long ago, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] remembers the benefits of using a similar style of governance and desires it for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil12!"

tylos_missions_task_12: "The Isle of Akar"
tylos_missions_task_12_DESC: "Perhaps we might go about purchasing some lands from the #E Seleukid Empire#!? Their holdings are so vast that they might be willing to part with two small islands, especially if the price is right. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

tylos_missions_task_21: "East Arabian Shipping"
tylos_missions_task_21_DESC: "While we certainly have plenty of room in [GetProvince('(int32)7202').GetName] for future growth, the amount of trade volumes that we handle have encouraged us to develop the nearby province of [GetProvince('(int32)7203').GetName] so that we might further our shipping potential. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil23!"
tylos_missions_task_22: "The Pearl Bank"

me_tylos_1_desc: "Hundreds of years ago, the Sages and Seers of [GetProvince('(int32)918').GetName] must have peered deeply into the future through the Fabric of the Stars, and surely they knew of the foretold hour of their destruction at the hands of #E Cyrus#! - the nadir of its long and rich history.\n\nYet there must have been consolation, as well, in the knowledge that all would not be lost forever, but that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] would forge anew what had been broken and lost so long ago. It brings the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] joy to see the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] assume [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] rightful place on the throne of Babylon."
me_tylos_1.a: "Babylon has risen again!"

me_tylos_2_title: "A Rich Memory"
me_tylos_2_desc: "In days of old, it is said that the Babylonian people were guided in their affairs by a powerful bureaucracy, one that was able to effectively adminster government while maintaining the blessings of the gods. There was a central figure known as the #E Lugal#! that ruled like a King would, assigning important tasks to deputies and advisors.\n\nNow that we have reformed the ancient nation of #E Tilmun#!, claiming by rights the authority and gravitas of that long-gone state, it has been proposed that we go one step further and actually adopt the #E Babylon Bureaucracy#! as our own manner of governance.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has argued that this will only bring legitimacy to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and shall do wonders to increase our international prestige, yet others claim this is a monarchy in all but name."

Greatly excited by this discovery, the excavations continued, and not one but three small temples were discovered in the heart of the city.\n\nWhile the center of Tylos was always considered to be among the most valuable real estate in our entire nation, there has been a mad dash amongst the nobility and the well-off [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] citizens to buy properties near the excavation site.
