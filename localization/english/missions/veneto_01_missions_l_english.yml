secure_venetia_mission_vnt_DESCRIPTION:0 "The lands of Venetia are vulnerable, and have already been subject to countless attacks. From our own arrival, from when we conquered the Eugani, to the Etruscans and the Gaulish invasions from the South and Northwest, and now a new power emerges from the South. Clearly, to defend our home, we must shore up defenses, as well as secure diplomatic ties with those who might otherwise seek to destroy us."
secure_venetia_mission_vnt_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed once we have ensured the long-term security of the region of Venetia."
secure_venetia_mission_vnt_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "We must ready our militias, and send out envoys!"

secure_venetia_mission_task_1:0 "Retake Adria"
secure_venetia_mission_task_1_DESC:0 "The City of Adria has a long History, having been built up by the Etruscans, colonized by the Greeks from Aegina and Syracuse, and now brought under the dominion of the Celtic Ligoni tribe. We however, were the first to settle in Adria, and while we have amicable relations with many of the Gallic tribes, Adria must be brought back under Venetic dominion, along with the rest of the Western border area."
secure_venetia_take_adria_tt:0 "The province of #Y Olena#! has be brought back entirely to #Y Venetic#! rule."

secure_venetia_mission_task_2:0 "Take the Mountain Pass"
secure_venetia_mission_task_2_DESC:0 "The mountains to our Northeast are not just some foreign wastelands that we can ignore, they are our access to the all-important Amber Road! If a hostile nation were to take control of the merchant posts around Carnia, and we were to be cut of from the source of the Amber, our commerce would surely suffer. We cannot allow that to happen!"
secure_venetia_take_the_mountain_pass_tt:0 "The mountainous outpost at #Y Carnia#! is under the control of #Y Veneto#!."

secure_venetia_mission_task_3:0 "Fortify Ateste"
secure_venetia_mission_task_3_DESC:0 "Atestes stands at the enterance to Venetia. It may be backed by the defendible Eugani Hills, but once passed any enemy would have free reign in the rest of our flatlands. The fortifications at Ateste must be improved at once!"
secure_venetia_fortify_este_tt:0 "A Fortress has been built in #Y Atestes#!."

secure_venetia_mission_task_4:0 "Fortify Carnia"
secure_venetia_mission_task_4_DESC:0 "With Carnia secured, we have taken direct control of yet another outpost that can secure our commercial routes. We should however, make sure that it stays within Venetian hands for the forseeable future."
secure_venetia_fortify_carnia_tt:0 "The #Y fort level#! at #Y Carnia#! has been brought up to 2."

secure_venetia_mission_task_5:0 "Bring in the Histrians"
secure_venetia_mission_task_5_DESC:0 "Venetia is by no means a united nation, however the Histri to the south have become particularly troublesome. Influenced by the Illyrians, our Histrian cousins have become savage pirates! For the sake of our merchants, we must stop this at once and bring them to heel!"
secure_venetia_bring_in_the_histrians_tt:0 "The nation of #Y Istria#! has been completely conquered."

secure_venetia_mission_task_6:0 "Ally the Cenomanni"
secure_venetia_mission_task_6_DESC:0 "While many of the Gauls that invaded Italy have come to blows with us, a few tribes have remained friendly. The Cenomanni, for example, have gone so far as to settle many areas across Veneto, and have abstained from the hostility towards us that other tribes have shown. It would be improper not to formalize our ties in an alliance!"
secure_venetia_ally_the_cenomani_tt:0 "#Y Veneto#! is allied to #Y Cenomannia#!."

secure_venetia_mission_task_7:0 "Gallic Colonies"
secure_venetia_mission_task_7_DESC:0 "Many Cenomanni Celts have already arrived in our lands, mingeling and assimilating into our homes and villages. The more men to protect our lands the better! And for a small incentive, we could surely reach a deal for more tribesmen to move in."
secure_venetia_gallic_colonies_tt:0 "#Y Lepontic#! Cenomanni Celts have been encouraged to settle."

secure_venetia_mission_task_8:0 "Adopt Gallic Warfare"
secure_venetia_mission_task_8_DESC:0 "So strong is the Celtic influence on Venetian society that our clothes, words and even tools have started to appear more and more Gallic. However the cream of the crop is our direction in the appropriation of Celtic warfare, with gaulish bronze swords and Celtic mail becoming commonplace. We must encourage this trend of miscegenation if we are to reap its full rewards on the field of battle."
secure_venetia_adopt_gallic_warfare_tt:0 "The #Y Lepontic#! culture has become fully integrated."

secure_venetia_mission_task_9:0 "Ally the Romans"
secure_venetia_mission_task_9_DESC:0 "The Romans, an agressive, bellicose peoples, have been expanding in the south for quite some time now. While their culture is quite comparable to the Etruscans, with which we are familiar, their martial dominance knows no equal. We would be fools not to try and establish relations with them."
secure_venetia_ally_the_romans_tt:0 "#Y Veneto#! is allied to #Y Rome#!."

secure_venetia_mission_task_10:0 "Swear Fealty to Rome"
secure_venetia_mission_task_10_DESC:0 "It is becoming quite clear just how mighty Rome is, their desire for expansion is unsatiable, and their armies are unstoppable. We Veneti on the otherhand, are descentralized, squabbling, and might very well do from the oversight of such a power. And besides, maybe Roman rule might bring some commercial opertunities too..."

secure_venetia_mission_task_11:0 "Ally the Etruscans"
secure_venetia_mission_task_11_DESC:0 "With central Italy facing an agressive new contender, and our old enemies, the Etruscans, under attack, maybe now would be a good oppertunity to make amends, and work together towards our common goals."

secure_venetia_mission_task_12:0 "Etruscan Protection"
secure_venetia_mission_task_12_DESC:0 "The Roman war machine is already at our doorstep, and we have little means of defending ourselves alone against this unstoppable force. It's becoming clearer and clearer that we must secure permanent protection from Etruria at all costs, even if it means bending the knee to old rivals."
secure_venetia_etruscan_protection_tt:0 "#Y Veneto#! has become a tributary of #Y Etruria#!."

secure_venetia_mission_task_13:0 "Venetic Supremacy"
secure_venetia_mission_task_13_DESC:0 "Chaos surrounds us, and titans threaten us. We have managed to make new alliances, but our own allies look upon our lands with mallicious intent. We will not, however, submit. We will be pragmatic in our diplomacy, but our liberty must always come first. If we must attack first, to eliminate our threats, then so be it."

secure_venetia_mission_task_14:0 "Favorable Diplomacy"
secure_venetia_mission_task_14_DESC:0 "It seems as if our diplomatic efforts our paying off, even if it has cost us. However, we ought to make sure that we have not neglected to check what one of our neighbours have been up to. We would be foolish to let our guard down at this point!"
secure_venetia_favorable_diplomacy_tt:0 "No neighbouring countries pose an immediate threat to #Y Veneto#!"

secure_venetia_mission_task_15:0 "Venetian Security" 
secure_venetia_mission_task_15_DESC:0 "Allies secured, and geopolitical position asserted, all that's left now is to consolidate any straggeling morsels of Venetic land not yet under our rule. Once all our lands are safe, and our Termons have been properly garrisoned and fortified, the lands of the Veneti will be truly unbreachable!"
secure_venetia_venetian_security_tt:0 "All Venetian lands have been consolidated, including all of #Y Olena#! and #Y Venetia#!."

secure_venetia_mission_task_16:0 "The Roman Ways"
secure_venetia_mission_task_16_DESC:0 "The more time that we spend as a part of the Roman Empire, the more we see the value in all things Roman. From the construction of aqueducts and roads, to the refined roman orations, even their gods seem appealing..."

secure_venetia_mission_task_17:0 "Into Illyria"
secure_venetia_mission_task_17_DESC:0 "Now that the Histri have finally been subjegated, we can see that our work is not yet complete. All along the Illyrian coast lie pirate heavens. But to do anything about that, we must first consolidate our foothold in Histria."
secure_venetia_push_into_illyria_tt:0 "#Y Veneto#! completely controls #Y Histria#!."

secure_venetia_mission_task_18:0 "A Venetian Adriatic"
secure_venetia_mission_task_18_DESC:0 "Illyrian pirates and bandits have long dominated the Adriatic sea, harassing our rightful waterways, and disturbing our precious trade. Well no more! We are in a position to finally put a stop to this, and we will show the Illyrians who really controls the Adriatic!"
