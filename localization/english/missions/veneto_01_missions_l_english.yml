secure_venetia_mission_event.16.t:0 "Alliance with the Veneti"
secure_venetia_mission_event.16.desc:0 "We have entered into an amicable alliance with the Veneti to the East. While this secures our eastern flank, it also conflicts with our longstanding relations with the Ligoni, who seem to compete with Veneto for land. We could try to maintain the status quo, but such fence-sitting may offend our new allies..."
secure_venetia_mission_event.16.a:0 "We best cut our ties with the Ligoni"
secure_venetia_mission_event.16.b:0 "Veneto has no say over our diplomacy!"

secure_venetia_mission_event.17.t:0 "Submission to Rome"
secure_venetia_mission_event.17.desc:0 "The mighty Roman war machine marches across Italia, swiping aside all who dare oppose her. But instead of resisting the Roman advance, the Venetian people see the Romans as a guarantee of law and order.\n We've therefore, decided to send a request to Rome, asking for oversight and judgement in our affairs, in return for recognition of their dominance over Italia."
secure_venetia_mission_event.17.a:0 "Let us see if they accept!"
secure_venetia_mission_event.17.a.tt:0 "Our offer of Tribute is sent."

secure_venetia_mission_event.18.t:0 "The Veneti Request Protection"
secure_venetia_mission_event.18.desc:0 "Our loyal allies, the Veneti, have requested our protection, and oversight over their local disputes.\n This is hardly surprising, for the Veneti have long been disunited and squabbling amongst their various city-states, however it is nonetheless an oppertunity to extend our domain further into Cisalpine Gaul. And an especially tempting one at that, considering such willingness to see the benefits of the Roman civilization..."  
secure_venetia_mission_event.18.a:0 "How right of them to seek our assistance!"
secure_venetia_mission_event.18.b:0 "Venetia would be better controlled more directly..."

secure_venetia_mission_event.19.t:0 "Bending the Kneel to the Etruscans"
secure_venetia_mission_event.19.desc:0 "The Etruscans may have been our enemies long ago, but a common enemy from the south has brought us together. But while we may be banded together for now, the powerbalance between us is still great, and the pressure of a concentrated Roman army in Venetia may yet cause our allies to abandon us. \n\nIt may therefore be necessary to make our own interests more direct Etruscan interests. And while bending the knee to our old rivals may sting, we may survive to once again rise to dominance in the future."
secure_venetia_mission_event.19.a:0 "It is time to send our proposal."
secure_venetia_mission_event.19.a.tt:0 "#Y Veneto#! submits to #Y Etruria#!."

secure_venetia_mission_event.20.t:0 "The Veneti Submit!"
secure_venetia_mission_event.20.desc:0 "Many times long past have Etruscans tried to break into the heartlands of Venetia, but we were never quite able to subdue them. Now however, with the threat of a greater power from the south, fear has finally brought them to heel!\n\n Their envoys are obviously bitter about having to offer the submission of their lands to us, but it seems as though their rebellious streak has finally come to an end."
secure_venetia_mission_event.18.a:0 "How right of them to finally bend the knee!"
secure_venetia_mission_event.18.b:0 "Ha! Now they seek our protection!"

secure_venetia_mission_event.21.t:0 "When in Rome..."
secure_venetia_mission_event.21.desc:0 "Our enterance into the Roman dominion was one without conflict. The Romans seem not to view us as simple barbarians, but as distant relatives, 'descendants of the Trojans', and have invested in projects of bringing their civilization to Venetia, even having made a colony called Aquillia. Most Veneti, on the other hand, have been welcoming the Romans in with open arms. And many are outright adopting the customs of our new overlords, wearing Roman dress, building Roman style houses and even worshiping the new Roman gods.\n\n\nSoon there will be no language on our streets but Latin."
secure_venetia_mission_event.21.a:0 "You know, the roman way of life seems awfully appealing"
secure_venetia_mission_event.21.b:0 "Worship of Jupiter won't go away, but let's maintain some of the old ways"
secure_venetia_mission_event.21.c:0 "These foreign heresies must be stamped out at any cost!"

secure_venetia_mission_event.22.t:0 "Rome Wishes for Further Integration"
secure_venetia_mission_event.22.desc:0 "While our current arrangement may be satisfactory for us, it is unsurprising that Rome increasingly views Venetia as yet another province of her Empire. And while we have been able to maintain a certain level of autonomy so far, it is becoming increasingly clear that Rome's expectations of our integration into their dominion is still far from our status quo. And that to break away from the expectations that Rome has, for our further absorbtion into their civilization, would be a grave insult."
secure_venetia_mission_event.22.a:0 "Very well, let us integrate further with rome!"
secure_venetia_mission_event.22.a.tt:0 "#Y Veneto#! will become a #Y Feudatory#! of #Y Rome#!.\n#Y Veneto#!'s name will change."
secure_venetia_mission_event.22.b:0 "This demand is a step too far, even from Rome"
secure_venetia_mission_event.22.b.tt:0 "#Y Rome#! will be extremely offended"

secure_venetia_mission_event.23.t:0 "The Veneti Reject Further Integration"
secure_venetia_mission_event.23.desc:0 "Venetia has long been enjoying the prosperity brought by Roman rule, their disputes have been mediated, and their borders protected by our own forces. But now, when their time has come to start paying their dues as a part of our dominion, they spit in our face!\n\nTheir audacity and insult must not go unanswered, we brought them peace and civilization, treating them as we would our own brothers, and they have betrayed us."
secure_venetia_mission_event.23.a:0 "It looks like we'll have to integrate the barbarians by force!"

secure_venetia_mission_event.27.t:0 "Vassalization of the Cenomanni"
secure_venetia_mission_event.27.desc:0 "While the Cenomanni have been our loyal allies for a while now, the time has come for our former lands to return to our control. Of course, considering our longheld friendship, peace and autonomy for our allies would be far more preferable to blood being shed. Besides, with our growing power, our direct protection would even be beneficial for the Cenomanni!\n\nOur envoys have already been sent, we just have to hope that our allies see reason..."
secure_venetia_mission_event.27.a:0 "Let's hope they accept!"

secure_venetia_mission_event.28.t:0 "Veneto requests Subserviance"
secure_venetia_mission_event.28.desc:0 "Woe is the day when our old allies turn from loyalty to greed. Our longtime friends, the #Y Veneti#! have audaciously requested our submission to them!\n\n\nThis is extremely undesirable to our people, however they are, at the very least, a people with which we are familiar and have many ties to. And besides, maybe swallowing our own pride would be preferable to facing their swords."
secure_venetia_mission_event.28.a:0 "They do seem to be growing in force,"
secure_venetia_mission_event.28.b:0 "They want WHAT?"
secure_venetia_mission_event.28.b.tt:0 "#Y Veneto#! will likely declare war on us"

secure_venetia_mission_event.29.t:0 "Cenomannia Refuses!"
secure_venetia_mission_event.29.desc:0 "It seems as though the Cenomanni have rudely refused our offer of protection and have cut their ties with us!\n With the importance that their lands hold for us, there is only one possible outcome..."
