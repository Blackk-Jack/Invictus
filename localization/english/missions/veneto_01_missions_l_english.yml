secure_venetia_mission_vnt:0 "Secure Venetia"
secure_venetia_mission_vnt_DESCRIPTION:0 "The lands of Venetia are flat and vulnerable, and have already been subject to countless foreign attacks. From our own arrival, from when we conquered the Eugani, to the Etruscans from the Southwest, and the Gaulish invasions from the Northwest, and now a new power rumbles from the South. Clearly, to defend our home, we must make use of the mountains which suround our Northeast, as well as secure diplomatic ties with those who might otherwise seek to destroy us."
secure_venetia_mission_vnt_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed once we have ensured the long-term security of the region of Venetia - we must secure our border areas, learn from those who have the means to fight effectively, and forge new diplomatic relationships."
secure_venetia_mission_vnt_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "We must ready our militias, and send out envoys!"
#Missions

secure_venetia_mission_task_1:0 "Retake Adria"
secure_venetia_mission_task_1_DESC:0 "The City of Adria has a long History, having been built up by the Etruscans, colonized by the Greeks from Aegina and Syracuse, and now brought under the dominion of the Celtic Ligoni tribe. We however, were the first to settle in Adria, and while we have amicable relations with many of the Gallic tribes, Adria must be brought back under Venetic dominion, along with the rest of the Western border area."
secure_venetia_take_adria_tt:0 "The province of #Y Olena#! has be brought back entirely to #Y Venetic#! rule!"

secure_venetia_mission_task_2:0 "Take the Mountain Pass"
secure_venetia_mission_task_2_DESC:0 "The mountains to our Northeast are not just some foreign wastelands that we can ignore, they are our access to the all-important Amber Road! If a hostile nation were to take control of the merchant posts around Carnia, and we were to be cut of from the source of the Amber, our commerce would surely suffer. We cannot allow that to happen!"

secure_venetia_mission_task_3:0 "Fortify Ateste"
secure_venetia_mission_task_3_DESC:0 "Atestes stands at the enterance to Venetia. It may be backed by the defendible Eugani Hills, but once passed any enemy would have free reign in the rest of our flatlands. The fortifications at Ateste must be improved at once!"

secure_venetia_mission_task_4:0 "Fortify Carnia"
secure_venetia_mission_task_4_DESC:0 "With Carnia secured, we have taken direct control of yet another outpost that can secure our commercial routes. We should however, make sure that it stays within Venetian hands for the forseeable future."

secure_venetia_mission_task_5:0 "Bring in the Histrians"
secure_venetia_mission_task_5_desc:0 "Venetia is by no means a united nation, however the Histri to the south have become particularly troublesome. Influenced by the Illyrians, our Histrian cousins have become savage pirates! For the sake of our merchants, we must stop this at once and bring them to heel!"

secure_venetia_mission_task_6:0 "Ally the Cenomani"
secure_venetia_mission_task_6_desc:0 "While many of the Gauls that invaded Italy have come to blows with us, a few tribes have remained friendly. The Cenomani, for example, have gone so far as to settle many areas across Veneto, and have abstained from the hostility towards us that other tribes have shown. It would be improper not to formalize our ties in an alliance!"

secure_venetia_mission_task_7:0 "Gallic Colonies"
secure_venetia_mission_task_7_desc:0 "Many Cenomani Celts have already arrived in our lands, mingeling and assimilating into our homes and villages. The more men to protect our lands the better! And for a small incentive, we could surely reach a deal for more tribesmen to move in."
