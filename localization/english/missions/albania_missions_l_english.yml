01_albania_task_21:0 "A Step on the Road of Trade"
01_albania_task_21_DESC:0 "While the Casucasian Mts. and the Hyrcanian Sea bound it geographically, they also funnel eurasian trade through the whole lenght of Caucasian Alabania, east to west and north to south. The people ought to harness their natural position and leverage it for the economic benefit of their lands."

01_albania_task_22:0 "Hyrcanian Sea Trade"
01_albania_task_22_DESC:0 "An ocean in of itself, the Hyrcanian Sea maybe be encircled by raiding parties of nomads, but, it does serve to connect the vast markets of the east with their buyers in the west. Should the Albanians not do as the Hyrcanians to the south and take charge of the waters even if the mountains and valleys are their natural home?"

01_albania_task_23:0 "A Capital in Khabala"
01_albania_task_23_DESC:0 "If people are to remember us long after our days are numbered, a great city will be required to house our legacy, if at least in name. Our strongest tribes and even the people before us have held Khabala to be a powerful perch from which to survey the land below and the roads leading in and out of our domain. Let us make this the perfect spot from which to wield our strength in both diplomacy and war."

01_albania_task_24:0 "Albanian Steeds"
01_albania_task_24_DESC:0 "As the Kura and Arax rivers join and, together, empty into the great Hyrcanian sea, they create a most fertile land. The steeds of the northern steppe were brought here long ago and they have prospered in the far-off fields. We would do well to adopt the powerful swiftness which the northern horselords wield, and use these beasts for our own purposes."

01_albania_task_25:0 "The Caspians"
01_albania_task_25_DESC:0 ""

01_albania_task_26:0 "Defending the Darband Pass"
01_albania_task_26_DESC:0 "One of, if not the most famous, gates of the Caucasus, the Darband Pass has been feared by many a great empire. While steppe hords have actually been noted for crossing into the Iranian Plateau via the Parthian 'Gates,' the Medes, Achaemenids, and other empires feared a nomadic incursion across the Caucasus for ages. However, who could not realize the potential of controlling such an important trading waystation which bridges two distinct worlds. Let us protect ourselves and become the best of traders and tax-collectors."

01_albania_task_27:0 "A Growing Population"
01_albania_task_27_DESC:0 "With Albanians and Caspians sustaining themselves on the same fields and the same seas, we need to ensure that our fertile lands are being utilized to their fullest extent - there is no peace among the starved. Put the able bodied people to work, so that their labor might help us all prosper."
