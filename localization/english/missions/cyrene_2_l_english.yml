There wasn't an empty seat to be found in the hippodrome this morning, for everyone knew that this would be the talk of the town for the foreseeable future and no one wanted to miss the spectacle. The #E Greeks#! arrived in swathes especially, dressed in their finest and eager to see the race begin. Eager vendors filled the stands, hawking their wares in shrill voices, and the aisles were filling up with peach pits and the pips of olives as the first rider entered.\n\nThe teams that filled the field were the #Y Paliourosiote Pegusi#! representing #E Paliouros#!, the #Y Kyrene Kings#! from #E Kyrene#!, the #Y Serapeion Scorpions#! of #E Serapeion#!, and the hometown team of #E Barka#!, the #Y Barka Basilisks#!.\n\nThe murmuring of the crowds was silenced at the cry of a horn, and there was an explosion of dust and activity as the riders erupted from their starting positions. As the first racer from the #Y Basilisks#! rounded the corner, all eyes turned to the spina in the center of the race track, watching the sunlight glimmering on a statuette of a silver dolphin - once this dolphin was removed, everyone knew that it would be the last lap.\n\nMoments into the race, it is anyone's game now - the #Y Scorpions#! lead the way, but soon they are #R rocked off course#! by the #Y Pegusi#!, who are whipping their mounts furiously. The roars reach their peaks with the hometown #Y Basilisks#! #R retaking the lead#! from the back, however, in the end the #Y Kyrene Kings#! would #R steal the victory#! with an epic comeback, trampling over the rider from the #Y Scorpions#! and nearly breaking his leg as they stormed across the finish line!\n\nThe energy of the event was said to have been felt from #E Carthage#! to #E Alexandria#!. It's a miracle no one was hurt, likely due to the #Y protection of #E Lady Barce#!#!. The finest doctors from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] were on hand, and although the rider from the #Y Scorpions#! was clearly shaken up, the praise of the good Lady was on his lips as he walked out of the arena to cheers.
