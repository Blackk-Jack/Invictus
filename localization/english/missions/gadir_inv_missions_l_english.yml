gadir_inv_mission_01_DESCRIPTION:0 "The Balearides, the islands that our people call home, are far away from the disturbances and wars that devastate the Eastern Mediterranean; occassionally, we hear news of these conflagrations from passing traders, and thank the gods that these disasters have avoided our homeland thus far. Although our isles are viewed as a sleepy backwater, hardly worth noticing, that does not mean that we do not harbor ambitions of our own."

After countless years of being a federated tribe, it has been decided to reward [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], who is most responsible for our current state of affairs, with the crown. No more shall we be ruled by councils of magistrates and elders, but we shall finally have a true sovereign to guide us.\n\nNo expense was spared for the coronation ceremony, as the finest wines and luxury foods were imported from abroad, supplementing the traditional dishes of our people. Borne on a litter of silver and ivory, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was paraded through the streets of [GetProvince('(int32)1465').GetName], showering gifts of golden coins upon the gathered crowds hoping to catch a glimpse of the royal procession. The feasting and celebration will last well into the evening, perhaps even until the early hours of the morning. A day to be remembered forevermore by our countrymen!"
