veneto_flavour_event.3.desc:0 "For the past few centuries, the cities of the Veneti have teetered on the very edge of destruction, constantly threatened by eternal invasions with low prospect for survival, nevermind growth. Against all odds however, the Cities have managed to consolidate themselves, and unite under a common $VNT_ADJ$ banner, expanding their collective reach beyond the original Venetic heartlands.\nNow that the protective wings of the Veneti streach over many different cities and peoples, united into prosperity and safety, it is time that this transmediterranian league was declared, so that all other countries know that our cities are protected by the naval might situated at [GetCountry('VNT').GetCapital.GetName]"

veneto_flavour_event.5.desc:0 "We have long been alone in our fight against our hostile Gallic neighbours. Now however, a new Italic power has arisen out of Central Italia, with the Roman war machine having reached our borders. They too have a long history of hostilities with certain Gallic tribes, and seek to defeat those Celtic nations in Cisalpine Gaul.\n\nIf we were to request an alliance with $ROM$, perhaps we could work together to bring peace and stability to the region..."
veneto_flavour_event.5.a:0 "Let us send them a request for amicitia!"
veneto_flavour_event.5.b:0 "We are perfectly fine fighting the Gauls on our own"

veneto_flavour_event.6.desc:0 "In our expansion into Cisalpine Gaul, our borders have met those of an isolated Italic people called the Veneti. They have recieved us warmly, and are interested in our great civilization.\nLike $ROM$, they too have long been plagued by the Gallic menace in Italia, and now offer to establish amicitia with us, in an alliance to fight the Gauls. In exchange, they assure us that they have much expertise to share in countering Gallic warfare tactics."
veneto_flavour_event.6.a:0 "We could do with an ally against the Gauls"
veneto_flavour_event.6.b:0 "Why ally the Veneti, when we can simply conquer them?"

veneto_flavour_event.7.desc:0 "Our neighbours far outclass us in size and power, but we have happily managed to secure alliances with some of the most powerfull nations in the region.\nStill, the power disparaty between us calls into question our current diplomatic stance towards stronger local powers.\n\nIf we are to continue maintaining our current diplomatic state of affairs, we might offend our much larger neighbours by denying their supremacy over the region. Our best option may therefore be to pursue a policy of appeasement."
veneto_flavour_event.7.a:0 "We must change the way our neighbours see us"
veneto_flavour_event.7.b:0 "Our current approach is fine!"

veneto_flavour_event.9.desc:0 "In the year 452 ab urbe condita, Kleonymos of Sparta arrived on the shores of Venetia, ready to sack, and possibly conquer, the city of Patavium. Having failed on a previous expedition of conquest and raiding across the Italian peninsula, this was the amitious prince's last gamble. With his sights set squarely on the city of #E [GetProvince('(int32)3594').GetName]#!, he marched his great army into Patavii territory, raiding the land as he went.\n\nThe Patavii, on the over hand, readied both their armies and navy to crush the forces of Kleonymos, lest he render their home to cinders..."
