icenia_mission_tree_task_1: "Friends At Our Back"
icenia_mission_tree_task_1_DESC: "We share a land border with many fiersome tribes and have reason to believe that some of them could make good allies in the wars to come - we should put these friendships to the test. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil7!"
icenia_mission_tree_task_1_tt: "#Y [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName]#! is allied with any country that has #Y Insular Celtic#! culture."

icenia_mission_tree_task_2: "Chariots Of Doom"
icenia_mission_tree_task_2_DESC: "Our society has long embraced the use of chariots, and the sight of our riders on the battlefield often causes the enemy to panic - send forth the #E Chariots of Doom#!! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil4!"
we_need_chariot_culture_tt: "We need the #T Britannic Military Tradition#! [GetMilitaryBonus('celtic_philosophy_start_bonus').GetName|Y]."

icenia_mission_tree_task_3: "Our True Intentions"
icenia_mission_tree_task_3_DESC: "The #E Trinovantians#! to our south have begun to build their settlements in our province of #E Icenia#! - a crime that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] will not allow to go unpunished. Let us spit in their faces before we bring them to heel! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil1!"
icenia_send_insult_tt: "We must #Y Send An Insult#! to #E Trinovantia#!."

icenia_mission_tree_task_4: "Bartering With The Belgae"
icenia_mission_tree_task_4_DESC: "It is well-known that our ruling classes are distantly related to the #Y Belgae#! tribes on the mainland - let us see if we can rekindle this connection in order to boost trade throughout all of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"

icenia_mission_tree_task_5: "The Battle For The South"
icenia_mission_tree_task_5_DESC: "Now that we are in a position to economically sustain long wars of conquest, we must throw ourselves into the battles to come with abandon - the cowardly shall never be able to prevail! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil5!"

icenia_mission_tree_task_6: ""
icenia_mission_tree_task_6_DESC: ""

icenia_mission_tree_task_7: "Icenian Horse Farms"
icenia_mission_tree_task_7_DESC: "It has been said that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people only have two loves; coins and horses. We take great pride in the animals that we raise, however, and ensure that our warhorses are trained to exacting standards. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil13!"
icenia_mission_tree_task_7_tt: "At least #Y 3#! territories in the regions of [GetProvince('(int32)2044').GetArea.GetName|Y] and [GetProvince('(int32)2068').GetArea.GetName|Y] that produce #Y Horses#! @horses! have a #Y Slave Estate#! building."

icenia_mission_tree_task_9: "Trade And Administration"
icenia_mission_tree_task_9_DESC: "Although our capital of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] is a city with unlimited potential, it is sorely lacking at the moment - we must begin transforming our seat of power into a center of trade and administration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil8!"

icenia_mission_tree_task_10: "Embracing La Tène Art"
icenia_mission_tree_task_10_DESC: "The distinctive #E La Tène#! style, with its swirling motifs and dazzlingly intricate patterns, is seeing a revival in the workshops of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], but there is much more that we could do when it comes to producing fine wares. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil2!"

icenia_mission_tree_task_11: "A Reputation For Metalworking"
icenia_mission_tree_task_11_DESC: "Our blacksmiths are the most skilled in all of #E Britannia#!, masters of working metal for whatever purpose is desired - whether torcs of gold or swords of iron are required, the forges of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] stand ready. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil6!"

icenia_mission_tree_task_12: "A Wooden Road"
icenia_mission_tree_task_12_DESC: "It has been proposed in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] that we should build a road that connects our northern port in [GetProvince('(int32)2031').GetName] with the rest of the province of #E Icenia#! - this will do wonders to help us streamline trade. Since wood is readily available to us, that shall be what we use for its construction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"
