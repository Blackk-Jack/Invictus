### Mission Tasks ###

# Saba
saba_task_0: "Kingdom In Decline"
saba_task_0_DESC: "By all measures, our kingdom appears to be in decline - our power and ability to project our might has considerably weakened over the last couple hundred years. All is not lost, however... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"
saba_task_1: "Expand The Capital City"
saba_task_1_DESC: "Our capital city, [GetProvince('(int32)4666').GetName], is in need of some repairs, particularly the #E Marib Dam#! that supplies our people with water. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has to make restoring our city a priority! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic11!"
saba_task_2: "Expand The Irrigation Network"
saba_task_2_DESC: "The #E Marib Dam Reservoir#! is a key player in ensuring that our crops are watered, and our food-producing territories in [GetProvince('(int32)4667').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)4665').GetName] would benefit greatly from an expanded irrigation network. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic7!"
saba_task_3: "The Temple Tithe"
saba_task_3_DESC: "Although some people grumble about having to pay tithes to our temples, how else are we supposed to keep the gods happy and bring their blessings upon us? There are things that are more valuable than money in this life, after all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"
saba_task_4: "The Israelite Communities"
saba_task_4_DESC: "There are many #E Israelite#! enclaves that are scattered throughout [GetProvince('(int32)4667').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName], and soon [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will rule over each and every one of them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil11!"
saba_task_5: "Expand The Mines"
saba_task_5_DESC: "The precious metals and gemstones that are in the distant hills are a valuable source of wealth and would do wonders for our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] economy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil25!"
saba_task_6: "Military Centre"
saba_task_6_DESC: "The inhabitants of [GetProvince('(int32)4682').GetName] are a tough and contentious people; exactly the type of people that we want for our armies. Let us invest in their settlement so that all of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will benefit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil17!"
saba_task_7: "The Kingdom Of Solomon"
saba_task_7_DESC: "The tales of King #E Solomon#!, said to be the wisest man that ever lived, have not been forgotten by the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] nation, who harbor a fondness for this esteemed ruler and his dynasty. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil23!"
saba_task_8: "Kingdom Rising"
saba_task_8_DESC: "The strength of our military forces is at an all-time high; a testament to the hard work that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has done to bring us to the pinnacle of our powers! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil13!"

saba_task_20: "Outward Ambitions"
saba_task_20_DESC: "Although we have plenty of issues to deal with at home, this does not mean that our ambitions do not face outward...\nThere are plenty of tribes throughout #E Arabia Felix#! that we will soon find ourselves engaging with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil9!"
saba_task_21: "Reabsorb Ma'in"
saba_task_21_DESC: "Over a century ago, the treacherous inhabitants of #E Ma'in#! expelled our soldiers and declared independence from us, and many believe that is when our time of troubles truly began.\n\nNow that we are in the position to do so, it is time to reabsorb them and to correct the mistakes of the past. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil5!"
saba_task_22: "Conquer Qataba"
saba_task_22_DESC: "The time has come to send our forces southward, into the hilly regions controlled temporarily by #E Qataba#! - the hour of battle is at hand! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil11!"
saba_task_23: "The Northern Border"
saba_task_23_DESC: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has had trouble sleeping lately, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] mind fixated upon the northern border - we must take steps to secure the region, lest we be caught unawares by an invading army. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"
saba_task_24: "Going East"
saba_task_24_DESC: "The inhabitants of #E Hadhramut#! to the east have a reputation for being fairweather friends, abandoning their gods when it appears politically expedient for them to do so. Let us quell these heathens once and for all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil14!"
saba_task_25: "Into Africa"
saba_task_25_DESC: "Now that we have conquered portions of #E Africa#!, we must have important discussions regarding the future of the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic4!"
saba_task_26: "Into The Desert"
saba_task_26_DESC: "The tribes that live in #E Kindah#! would never be able to defeat us in battle - a fact that we both know - so maybe they would submit to us outright? It couldn't hurt to ask...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"
saba_task_27: "Control Macrobia"
saba_task_27_DESC: "The coast of the land of #E Punt#! will be a valuable addition to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] possessions for many reasons - let us not delay in taking the region for ourselves. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil10!"
saba_task_28: "Macrobian Ventures"
saba_task_28_DESC: "As was promised, the wealth of the #T Macrobians#! flows into the treasury of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], although it is widely believed that there is more we could do to increase our profits. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil4!"
saba_task_29: "Dragonblood Island"
saba_task_29_DESC: "The isle of [GetProvince('(int32)7530').GetName] must submit to our authority, one way or another - prepare our fleets and send them to the Dragonblood Island. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil21!"
saba_task_30: "Finding A Lost Tribe"
saba_task_30_DESC: "What should we do the tribes of #E 'Aad#!, now that we have moved into their territory? Perhaps we do not have to conquer them outright...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil8!"

saba_task_40: "Of Frankincense And Myrrh"
saba_task_40_DESC: "The world knows our region primarily because of two trade goods; the luxurious incenses frankincense and myrrh. In addition to these two valuable perfumes, we also produce spices that cannot be found anywhere else. We should take all of the steps necessary to manufacture as much of these items as we can. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil2!"
saba_task_41: "Trade Hub"
saba_task_41_DESC: "Merchants travel far and wide to visit our markets, and our coastal regions have the potential to become a trade hub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"
saba_task_42: "Dominate The Market"
saba_task_42_DESC: "We have assumed our rightful place as masters of trade in our region - our reputation and treasuries grow expontentially! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"

saba_task_50: "Stabilise The Kingdom"
saba_task_50_DESC: "If we can reduce the deleterious effects of aggressive expansion on our kingdom and raise our internal stability, then we will be on the road to digging ourselves out of the hole that we are currently in. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil7!"
saba_task_51: "Form An Administration"
saba_task_51_DESC: "Our noble classes are desperate to see the declining fortunes of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] reversed and are willing to do what they can to help. We should look to the untapped potential of these great families and form a new administration with members of the nobility. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil20!"
saba_task_52: "Reform The Army"
saba_task_52_DESC: "Unless we have a reformed army, one that is suited to fighting the types of wars that we will be waging, we cannot hope to escape the predicament that we are in. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil2!"
saba_task_53: "A Strong Population"
saba_task_53_DESC: "We need to rely on our superior numbers to ensure our safety - our citizens fight in our levies, guard our city walls and keep the wheels of our economy spinning. We cannot allow our enemies to be stronger than us! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil9!"
