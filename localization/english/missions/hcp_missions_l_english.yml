 hcp_mission_01:0 "Last of the Achaemenids"
 hcp_mission_01_DESCRIPTION:0 "How the mighty have fallen, the Achaemenids, who once ruled the largest empire the world had ever seen, now reduced to a rump state thousands of leagues from their homeland surrounded by foreign powers!"
 hcp_mission_01_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete after we have expanded our rule over the north Pontic coast and secured our dynasty's position."

# Missions
####################
 hcp_mission_01_task_01:0 "Securing the Succession"
 hcp_mission_01_task_01_DESC:0 "It is hardly a secret that Amastris' sons, Oxyathres and Klearchos have a deep-seated rivalry with one another and both eye their mother's position greedily. Perhaps if we arrange a joint wedding for the two of them with some of the most prestigious families of the old empire we can placate them before they consider anything...drastic."
 hcp_mission_01_task_02:0 "The Pontic League"
 hcp_mission_01_task_02_DESC:0 "The city states of Sesamos and Tieion are in a pact of mutual defense with us, perhaps with the right offer we can develop this relation into something more to our benefit."
 hcp_mission_01_task_03:0 "Stabilising our Rule"
 hcp_mission_01_task_03_DESC:0 "While foreign enemies still surround us on all sides, our position is not quite as precarious as it was before. Now we have a sizeable powerbase we can begin to look outward and consider expanding our realm."
 hcp_mission_01_task_04:0 "Into Paphlagonia"
 hcp_mission_01_task_04_DESC:0 "If we are to survive the years to come our realm must expand. The northern coastline region of Paphlagonia is agreed to be the most suitable target."
 hcp_mission_01_task_05:0 "Found Amastris"
 hcp_mission_01_task_05_DESC:0 "The "city" of Sesamos is in reality just a collection of several seperately administered Greek colonies. We should centralise rule over them and found a true city worthy of our ancestors!"
 hcp_mission_01_task_06:0 "Pontic Magi"
 hcp_mission_01_task_06_DESC:0 "While we are tolerant folk and allow our subjects to worship who they please it is no excuse for our lack of formal Zoroastrian priesthood, or "magi" in our nation. Let us work to invite some learned men from the east to spread the light of Ahura Mazda to those who wish to listen."
 hcp_mission_01_task_07:0 "Pacify the Mariandyni"
 hcp_mission_01_task_07_DESC:0 "The Mariandynians are a fierce tribe of Thracians who are well known to chafe under foreign rule. Perhaps a softer approach is called for?"
 hcp_mission_01_task_08:0 "Thracian Auxiliaries"
 hcp_mission_01_task_08_DESC:0 "Our patronage and acceptance of the local Thracian tribesmen has borne fruit, many of them are now flocking to our army. We should establish formal auxiliary regiments for them."
 hcp_mission_01_task_09:0 "Orontid Overtures"
 hcp_mission_01_task_09_DESC:0 "The Orontid dynasty served our family as faithful satraps for generations. Let us remind them of the ties we share."
 hcp_mission_01_task_10:0 "Develop Sinope"
 hcp_mission_01_task_10_DESC:0 "The city of Sinope is one of the oldest of all the Ionian colonies but has seen better days. We should take efforts to ensure it's legacy as a major trade hub endures."
 hcp_mission_01_task_11:0 "Anatolian Citizenship"
 hcp_mission_01_task_12:0 "Military Reform"
 hcp_mission_01_task_12_DESC:0 "Simple words cannot begin to describe how woefully unprepared we were for a war against the greeks. Alexander decisively defeated us on numerous occasions despite our clear numerical advantage. Efforts must be taken to ensure this never happens again!"
 hcp_mission_01_task_13:0 "Rethinking our Tactics"
 hcp_mission_01_task_13_DESC:0 "It is clear from our studies that a reform of our command structure and military doctrine is needed. Our troops will likely struggle to keep up with this constant change but we will be able to better focus on innovating our tactics."
 hcp_mission_01_task_14:0 "The New Immortals"
 hcp_mission_01_task_14_DESC:0 "The Greek historian, Herodotus gave this name to our elite infantry force due to them being kept constantly at a strength of exactly 10,000 men. Every killed, seriously wounded, or sick soldier was immediately replaced with a new one, maintaining a cohesive force with a constant strength."
 hcp_mission_01_task_15:0 "The Cataphract"
 hcp_mission_01_task_15_DESC:0 "Literally meaning "armoured" or "completely enclosed" the cataphract was adapted from our empire's early encounters with the Scythians and Parni tribes of the north. If we can ensure a stable supply of capable mounts bred solely for war we will be able to field more of these nigh unstoppable cavalry!"
 hcp_mission_01_task_16:0 "Learning from Defeat"
 hcp_mission_01_task_16_DESC:0 "There is no denying that Alexander was a prodigy, unfathomably gifted in the art of war. In order to better protect ourselves from his successors we will try to entice some veterans of his and his successors campaigns to settle in our lands, there is much we can learn from them."
 hcp_mission_01_task_17:0 "A True Persian Army"
 hcp_mission_01_task_17_DESC:0 "This has been a massive undertaking, but we have created a Persian army the likes of which has not been seen since the time of Darius I, the world will tremble!"
 hcp_mission_01_task_18:0 "Pontic Hegemony"
 hcp_mission_01_task_18_DESC:0 "We are now the undisputed masters of northern Anatolia, foreign diplomats curry favour in our courts and greek, persian and anatolian alike live together in relative harmony!"
 hcp_mission_01_task_19:0 "Fishy Business"
 hcp_mission_01_task_19_DESC:0 "The Euxine is home to countless schools of fish, investing into the fishing industry as well as the saltworks at #Y [GetProvince('(int32)1807').GetName]#! will provide a boost to both our economy and population growth!"
 hcp_mission_01_task_20:0 "Rethinking our Relationship"
 hcp_mission_01_task_20_DESC:0 "The Armenians have been steadfast allies during our meteoric resurgence. However, as we are now the clear senior partner in the alliance, perhaps it is time to reconsider our relationship"
 hcp_mission_01_task_21:0 "Greco-Persian Culture"
 hcp_mission_01_task_21_DESC:0 "Greeks and Persians have a...complicated history and erasing the animosity between our peoples will be no small task. If we can set aside our differences there are countless things Greeks and Persians can learn from one another."
 hcp_mission_01_task_22:0 "Legacy of Cambyses"
 hcp_mission_01_task_22_DESC:0 "Cambyses II created the first ever true naval fighting force in the world and his vision led to the widespread use of the Liburnian throughout the world's seas. Let us ensure we honour this legacy with a formidable navy of our own!"
 hcp_mission_01_task_final:0 "The Achaemenid Kingdom"
 hcp_mission_01_task_final_DESC:0 "Though we are still far from home and our enemies still numerous. The Achaemenid dynasty is once more a formidable power and it is time to make our return known to the world!"

 me_hcp_01.0.desc:0 "It is strange to think that just a few decades ago, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] dynasty ruled the largest empire the world had ever seen, stretching from the Indus river in the East to the Propontis in the west. But that all changed with the coming of the usurper king, Alexander. Now only the small kingdom of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is all that remains of the realm of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective]s. Surrounded on all sides by foreign rulers who eye our lands with greed. Only time will tell if [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has the ambition and determination to lead us back to the path of greatness!"
 me_hcp_01.0.a:0 "We will restore the glory of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective]s, no matter the cost!"
 
 me_hcp_01.1.t:0 "The Pontic League"
 me_hcp_01.1.desc:0 "The small states of [GetCountry('TIE').GetName] and [GetCountry('SMS').GetName] are undoubtably the junior partners in our alliance and with an appropriate "gift" they will surely come to see things this way too. They know the alternative if they refuse..."

 me_hcp_01.5.t:0 "The Royal Wedding"
 me_hcp_01.5.desc:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] looked over at her sons, a faint smile playing across her lips. Today was the first day she had seen them both laughing together since before the death of Dionysius. The two of them had grown distant since then though it seems the festivities (and the expensive wine) had brought them closer once more, if only for a moment. Both seemed satisfied with their brides, who had impressed the court with their wit and beauty, though that was to be expected from families as prestigious as theirs."
 me_hcp_01.5.a:0 "We set all of our worries aside, for today at least"
  
 me_hcp_01.6.t:0 "Mariandyni flock to the army"
 me_hcp_01.6.desc:0 "Our relaxed approach to governing the Mariandynians has seemed to have worked well, the hill tribesmen greet our tribute collectors and envoys with open arms and some have even began migrating to urban areas. Naturally, many Mariandynian men are enlisting into the military and our generals believe organising them into local auxiliary regiments will give them the soldiering life they desire while also providing a much-needed boost to the size of our forces."
 me_hcp_01.6.a:0 "It is an honour to fight alongside such capable warriors!"

 me_hcp_01.7.t:0 "Strengthening our Position"
 me_hcp_01.7.desc:0 "Against all odds we have done it! In the chaos of the Fourth War of the Diadoachi we have managed to grow our realm from a small city state to a fledgling Persian kingdom. As most of our subjects are Greek, Thracian and Anatolian it is unsurprising they were initially distrustful or even downright resentful of Persian rule. However, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective]'s wise and benevolent rule has captured the hearts and minds of our subjects and the people cheer the name of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]from every street!\n\nNow that our dynasty's domestic position is secure, it is time to turn our gaze outwards, toward the east..."

A large portion of the old empire's "Royal Road" stretched through it's mountains and valleys and the region prospered under the wise government of our satraps. \n\nTo solidify our relationship and show our commitment to coexistence rather than conquest, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has ordered the formation of a contingent of palace guards comprised entirely of #E Cappadocian#!, #E Phrygian#!, #E Paphlagonian#! and #E Armenian#! soldiers. Sworn to protect the monarch and their family these men must swear absolute loyalty to the ruler. Such an important and prestigious role will surely endear the people towards us!"

 me_hcp_01.9.desc:0 "Thanks to our investment into the region, business is booming once more in [GetProvince('(int32)1812').GetName]!

A shortage of raw materials means most are equipped with poor quality weapons or farm tools and we are often forced to rely on mercenaries to bolster our forces numbers. This sad state of affairs cannot continue, and so [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] and our #Y Argdabh#! have put forward a series of ambitious proposals to reform the army into a more professional and well equipped force. One capable of contending with the threats that we will face in the future."

 me_hcp_01.22.t:0 "Council Concludes"
 me_hcp_01.22.desc:0 "It has been a long and divisive series of meetings but the military reform council has finally reached a consensus on how to proceed.\n\n All but the most stubborn and reactionary of our officers agreed that our methods require improving and relying on mercenaries or conscription is simply inadequate. Therefore, it was agreed that the primary goals of the reforms were as follows:\n\n I. Secure raw materials for equipment and outfitting of soldiers\n\n II. Reinstate and modernise the legendary #Y Immortals#! as a martial backbone and inspiration for all our men, as well as serving as our monarch's royal guard.\n\n III. Secure larger-scale breeding of warhorses, allowing us to field large quantities of powerful #Y Cataphract#! cavalry.\n\n IV.Adopt and develop tactics used against us in the campaigns of Alexander, ensuring that such a humiliation can never happen again!\n\n The council agrees if we can succesfully adopt these four points, our military will be able to challenge the upstart #R Diodachi#! and have the means to reclaim Persia!"
